Traffic Accident Data Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. It aims to visualize accident hotspots and understand contributing factors using machine learning and data visualization techniques.

🎯 Objectives

Identify accident trends based on road conditions, weather, and time of day.

Detect high-risk accident hotspots using geospatial analysis.

Analyze contributing factors using machine learning models.

Provide interactive visualizations for better insights.

📊 Dataset

The dataset consists of accident records with features such as:

Date and time of accidents

Location (latitude, longitude)

Weather conditions (rain, fog, snow, etc.)

Road surface conditions (dry, wet, icy, etc.)

Severity of accidents (minor, serious, fatal)

🔍 Data Analysis & Visualization

1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values.

Identified trends in accidents based on time of day, weather, and road conditions.

Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to create bar charts, histograms, and box plots.

2️⃣ Accident Hotspot Detection

Used Folium and Geospatial Analysis to plot accident-prone areas.

Clustered accident locations using K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).

3️⃣ Machine Learning-Based Factor Analysis

Applied Random Forest, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and SVM to identify key accident factors.

Feature importance analysis to determine the most significant factors contributing to accidents.

4️⃣ Time & Weather Impact on Accidents

Analyzed accident distribution across different times of the day.

Studied the correlation between weather conditions and accident severity.

Used heatmaps to visualize patterns.

📌 Key Findings

Rush Hours & Night-time Accidents: Higher accident rates during peak hours and late-night driving.

Weather Impact: Increased accidents in foggy and rainy conditions.

Road Conditions: Wet and icy roads significantly contribute to severe accidents.

Accident Hotspots: Certain intersections and highways are more prone to accidents.
